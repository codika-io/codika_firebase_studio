# 🚀 Codika Flutter Template for Firebase Studio

Welcome to the **official Codika template** for [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/)!  
This template provides a blazing-fast, zero-setup development environment powered by **Codika**, **Flutter**, and the **Firebase ecosystem**.

With a single click, you can launch a fully preconfigured workspace in the cloud — no local setup required.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This template uses:

- A custom `.idx/dev.nix` file to define your cloud development environment
- `codika create -c codika.yaml` instead of `flutter create`, allowing you to scaffold projects the Codika way
- Configurable parameters (soon!) to adjust your Codika setup at workspace launch

---

## 📦 Customization

Want to tweak the starter? You can:

- Fork this repo
- Edit the `idx-template.nix` and `.idx/dev.nix` files to change the bootstrap or add tooling
- Update the `codika.yaml` file for different project scaffolds

To use your version, replace the repo URL in the button above with your own.
